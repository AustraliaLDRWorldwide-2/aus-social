A social media web app is a platform that allows users to create profiles, share content, and connect with others online. Users can post various types of content such as text, images, videos, and links, and interact with others by liking, commenting, and sharing their posts. The platform usually includes features like messaging, notifications, and a news feed to keep users up-to-date on the latest posts from their network. Additionally, social media web apps may offer privacy settings to allow users to control who can see their content and manage their personal information. The goal of a social media web app is to facilitate communication and social interaction among users and provide a platform for sharing ideas and experiences.
